Click "Create job."
Provide a name for your job (e.g., "MP4toHLS").
Choose an appropriate queue (default is usually fine).
Under "Settings," expand "Inputs" and click "Add."
Select "S3" as the source type and paste the public URL of your uploaded MP4 file from step 2.
Expand "Outputs" and click "Add."
Choose "HLS" as the output type. This will create an Apple HLS package.
You can customize output settings like bitrate, resolution, and segment duration under "Output settings."

Once the job is complete, you'll see the output location details under the "Outputs" section.
It will typically be an S3 path within your chosen bucket.
Navigate to the S3 console and locate the HLS output directory.
You'll find the manifest file (usually master.m3u8) and the segmented video files.
